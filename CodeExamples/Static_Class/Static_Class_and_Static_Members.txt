The following list provides the main features of a static class:

	-> Contains only static members.

	-> Cannot be instantiated.

	-> Is sealed.

	-> Cannot contain Instance Constructors. But Contain Static Constructors .

============================================================================================================================================
	
	In summary, the main difference between static properties in a static class and a non-static class is that a static class cannot be
	instantiated, and its static properties are accessed only through the class name, while a non-static class can be instantiated, and
	its static properties can be accessed through both the class name and instances of the class. The choice of which to use depends on
	your design requirements and whether you need to associate the static property with instances of the class or not.
