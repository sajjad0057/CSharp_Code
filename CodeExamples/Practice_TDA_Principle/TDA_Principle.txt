Tell don't ask principle :
===========================
Tell-Don't-Ask is a principle that helps people remember that object-orientation is about bundling
data with the functions that operate on that data. It reminds us that rather than asking an object
for data and acting on that data, we should instead tell an object what to do.


This principle is intended for designing classes in such a way that when they are used, instead of querying
their object/instance and performing the operation based on the output it provides, the instance should handle
the logic itself.
